The activities of the TUM Think tank are differenciated on the website amongst 5 content types:

- Projects
- Events
- Training
- News
- Project output
- test

## Projects

All projects, programmes or other initiatives at the TUM Think Tank.

Those can range from actual projects, support programmes to loose network initiatives and are displayed in a flat, non-hirarchical system.

## Events and trainings

Events and trainings are structured simiarly yet differenciated on a strategic level. 

**Events** are general event activities conducted by the think tank and it's affiliated projects, whereas **Trainings** are specific strategic training programmes within the Think Tanks mission of stakeholder engagement and knowledge dissemination.

## News and Project Output

News and project output are as well structured similarly yet have a different significance within the think tank’s work.

**Project outputs** are planned deliverables of projects and other diliberatedly produced project output. Output generated by third parties (such as project-related media apearances), or project presentations at external events would be considered as classic communication work and therefore be featured as **News**. General noteworthy content about the think tank’s work would be classified as News as well.
